# uhlive-example-advanced

This example loads the `@uhlive/javascript-sdk` package and let you decide when
to start listening. It also doesn't inject the transcript in the DOM, but let
you decide what to do with it.

Try the example with:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Then go to <http://localhost:3000> and allow access to microphone
